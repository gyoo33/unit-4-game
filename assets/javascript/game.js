// at the start of every game, there's a randomly generated number, which has a value between 19 - 120

// there are 4 crystals and each have a different randomly generated number, which are hidden from the user, and values should be between 1 - 12

// each time you click on a crystal, user will add the amount of points the crystal is worth to the total score

// only way to find out how much a crystal is worth is to click on it

// goal is to match user's total score to the random number

// if user's total score is less than random number, then user keeps playing

// if user's total score matches random number, then user is alerted they won (in wins/loss counter div) and counter for wins will increment by 1, and random number resets automatically, and total score is reset to 0, crystal values also resets automatically to a new random number

// if user's total score is greater than random number, then user is alerted they lost in wins/loss counter div) and counter for losses will increment by 1, and random number resets automatically, and total score is reset to 0, crystal values also resets automatically to a new random number
